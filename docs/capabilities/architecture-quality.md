# Architecture Quality






Software engineering is a socio-technical activity. Software is built by teams of people, working together to produce a joint product. High performers in socio-technical architecture quality show faster issue resolution times. To avoid the problems related to low architecture quality, it is recommended to avoid large system sizes, consistently pursue the reduction of coupling between components, and pay attention to the even distribution of developer activity across the system components.

The SIG Architecture Quality model measures the socio-technical architecture of software systems, providing insight into the ability of the architecture to evolve and scale.

Organizations have long been under pressure to evolve their software landscapes in a way that aligns with ever-changing business demands. Systems no longer able to meet these changing demands are commonly referred to as legacy systems, which need to be modernized to address these challenges. 

IT teams everywhere want to make the leap to modernization, but such an initiative presents enormous challenges and risks. In fact, 74% of organizations fail to complete legacy modernization projects, according to a recent report by Advanced.

“Legacy” means much more than just outdated technology. Rather, it refers to any pre-existing software solution that has become too fragile for changes to be timely, predictable, and reliable, usually due to poor architecture, or team knowledge loss.

SIG uses an Architecture Quality Model to quantify these aspects of socio-technical software architecture. The model captures six architecture aspects, covering both technical and social aspects, and evaluates the results against other systems in SIG’s benchmark.
