The maintainability section on the system level has 4 views: 
1. The *Overview* tab brings the main metrics together. 
2. The *Component Dependencies* tab visualizes architectural layering and connections.
3. The *Refactoring Candidates* tab groups and prioritizes code that does not meet 4 star quality. 
4. The *Delta quality* view shows the impact of new code changes on the entire portfolio for the selected period. By default it is grouped per system.
