# Portfolio-level maintainability

The maintainability section on the portfolio level has two main views: *Overview* and *Delta quality*. Both views include all the systems of your portfolio in one place. <img src="../images/portfolio-maintainability-menu.png" width="80" />. 

The *Overview* tab brings the main metrics together.

The *Delta quality* view shows the impact of new code changes on the entire portfolio for the selected period. By default it is grouped per system.

The information can be filtered and sorted by metadata (such as supplier, team, or division) by using the filter button:

## Analysis questions for portfolio/trend views
To gauge portfolio health and portfolio trends, example analysis questions are:
* Is the portfolio balanced with business objectives and (enterprise) architecture roadmaps? 
* Do some systems appear to be in trouble while they should have a long life ahead of them? Are quality trends heading in the right direction? 
* Which direction is technical debt moving? Does this impede developers to support the business with sufficient speed and quality?
