# Sigrid workflow for architects

As an enterprise architect, a big part of your role is understanding the current "as-is" architecture of the systems your team is working with. Then, equipped with such understanding, you can foster innovation and accelerate strategic IT improvements.
By seeing where you are and if you are moving in the right direction, you can ensure that the recent changes in your system's build quality are having the desired impact.

## Prevent new technical debt by setting guidelines and improving collaboration

Sigrid Objective Creator allows you to set system-specific objectives. With it, you can confer and settle on a plan with all teams. As a result, goals are made clear to all members and stakeholders upfront.
This improves collaboration and creates alignment at a higher level than just "the code in front of you, " making it valuable for multiple teams and stakeholders across these teams, making Sigrid an integral part of your architectural decisions.

## Prioritize initiatives with the best ROI

Not every initiative will have the same impact and as an enterprise architect, you should be able to prioritize the initiatives which can give you the best return based on the effort you spend on them. The higher the impact is, the more worthy it can be to spend extra time on a given effort.
By allowing you to define objectives at a portfolio-wide level, Sigrid gives you a detailed overview of where exactly your focus must go.

## Reduce maintenance efforts by giving non-functional requirements the right priority

Non-functional requirements aren't always top of mind when it comes to managing technical debt or maintenance efforts. Because these are usually concerned with the operation and usage of a given system instead of directly relating to its specific features, they can be harder to correlate with the overall system quality. As an enterprise architect, Sigrid can help you to reduce the maintenance efforts of your team by putting you in the driver's seat for prioritizing non-functional requirements. Then, you and your team can stay on top of all possible requirements and ensure that the work being done is prioritized correctly.

## Improve developer happiness with clear architecture quality insights

Code can be looked at through different lenses by different stakeholders. Sigrid offers you an overview of your current architecture at the level where you can make a difference. By offering you clear architecture quality insights, it enables you to act as a liaison between different teams in your organization and uncover certain details that would be otherwise buried deep within the complexity of your system.
