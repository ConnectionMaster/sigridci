# Sigrid workflow for architects

As an enterprise architect, a big part of your role is understanding the current "as-is" architecture of the systems your team is working with. Then, equipped with such understanding, you can foster innovation and accelerate strategic IT improvements.
By seeing where you are and if you are moving in the right direction, you can ensure that the recent changes in your system's build quality are having the desired impact.

## Prioritize initiatives with the best ROI

Not every initiative will have the same impact and as an enterprise architect, you should be able to prioritize the initiatives which can give you the best return based on the effort you spend on them. The higher the impact is, the more worthy it can be to spend extra time on a given effort.
By allowing you to define objectives at a portfolio-wide level, Sigrid gives you a detailed overview of where exactly your focus must go.
