# Sigrid workflow for architects

As an enterprise architect, a big part of your role is understanding the current "as-is" architecture of the systems your team is working with. Then, equipped with such understanding, you can foster innovation and accelerate strategic IT improvements.
By seeing where you are and if you are moving in the right direction, you can ensure that the recent changes in your system's build quality are having the desired impact.

## Prevent new technical debt by setting guidelines and improving collaboration

Sigrid Objective Creator allows you to set system-specific objectives. With it, you can confer and settle on a plan with all teams. As a result, goals are made clear to all members and stakeholders upfront.
This improves collaboration and creates alignment at a higher level than just "the code in front of you, " making it valuable for multiple teams and stakeholders across these teams, making Sigrid an integral part of your architectural decisions.
