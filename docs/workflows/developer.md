# Sigrid workflow for developers

As a developer, you will be interacting with other stakeholders during your day-to-day work, providing your unique perspective on the codebase as someone who actually writes the code and implements the necessary features.
As a project evolves, a lot of details can change over time, like the teams who work on it, the scope and requests from customers. Your task as a developer then becomes managing all these aspects together.

Sigrid can help you balancing these aspects, by allowing you to define objectives for non-functionals (e.g. test code coverage, state of open-source libraries used, etc.), and then providing you with information that will help you to track progress towards those objectives as part of your process. 


## Set your quality objectives

As a developer, when writing code, be it extending existing code with new functionalities, improving non-functionals or adding new features to an existing codebase, it's important to align with other stakeholders on your quality objectives.
Sigrid allows you to define objectives across several distinct capabilities which can then be monitored by yourself, as a developer, and by your fellow colleagues, to ensure that you and your entire team are moving in the right direction.
By setting your quality objectives, you set your future colleagues and your future self for working with a more maintainable codebase and ensuring everyone, from developers to product owners is on the same page.

## Sigrid integrated into your pipeline

Developers in modern software development teams tend to work with agile processes. The cornerstone of such processes is adhering to the mantra: _release early and often_.
What this means is that the development process has become much more nimble, supported by an infrastructure that enables developers to release small batches of working code very often.
In such a fast-paced environment, ensuring the quality of your code can be a complex task. 
Sigrid integrates with your development platform, so you can use Sigrid’s feedback as input for your normal code review process. Sigrid’s feedback is related to the quality objectives you defined earlier. This keeps your work aligned with the bigger picture at higher levels of the organization.

## Manage code quality over time 

As a developer, you know that there's no such thing as perfect code. Code quality exists in a context, both social and technical, in which the technologies you choose and the teams you work with can change during the lifetime of a project. That's why, as a developer, actively working on a given codebase and within a rapidly changing team, it's fundamental to have tools that give you insights into how code is evolving over time.
It's okay to accept that the code is not in the state where you want it to be _today_. But, when you see the needle moving in the right direction over time, be it a sprint or a quarter, then you know you are moving in the right direction.
Sigrid offers you timelines on your code quality, allowing you to look at newly added and/or modified code over a certain period of time, so you and your team are in complete control over the quality of your code.

## Plan ahead

No matter how well you do, there will always be technical debt. Sigrid helps you explore and gain control over your technical debt, so that you can incorporate it into your functional roadmap and sprint planning. Moreover, the need to work on technical debt becomes very clear. Sigrid also supports you in getting this prioritized by allowing you to select specific findings and "promote them" into a template in markdown format that can easily be added to your JIRA, Github, or Gitlab boards, for full transparency and control of your development process in a top-down fashion.
At the same time, by keeping Sigrid close to your code, you can always be sure that you as a developer will be moving in the best possible direction at all times.
