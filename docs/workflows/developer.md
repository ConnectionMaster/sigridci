# Sigrid workflow for developer

## Setting your quality objectives

As a developer, when writing code, be it extending existing code with new functionalities, improving non-functionals, or adding new features to an existing codebase, it's important to align with other stakeholders on your quality objectives.
Sigrid allows you to define objectives across several distinct capabilities which can then be monitored by yourself, as a developer, and by your fellow colleagues, to ensure that you and your entire team are moving in the right direction.
By setting your quality objectives, you set your future colleagues and your future self for working with a more maintainable codebase and ensuring everyone, from developers to product owners is on the same page.
