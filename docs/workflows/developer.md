# Sigrid workflow for developer

## Setting your quality objectives

As a developer, when writing code, be it extending existing code with new functionalities, improving non-functionals, or adding new features to an existing codebase, it's important to align with other stakeholders on your quality objectives.
Sigrid allows you to define objectives across several distinct capabilities which can then be monitored by yourself, as a developer, and by your fellow colleagues, to ensure that you and your entire team are moving in the right direction.
By setting your quality objectives, you set your future colleagues and your future self for working with a more maintainable codebase and ensuring everyone, from developers to product owners is on the same page.

## Sigrid integrated into your pipeline

Developers in modern software development teams tend to work with agile processes and a cornerstone of such processes is adhering to the mantra: _release early and often_.
What this means is that the development process has become much more nimble, supported by an infrastructure that enables developers to release small batches of working code very often.
In such a fast-paced environment, ensuring the quality of your code can be a complex task. 
Sigrid integrates with your development platform, so you can use Sigrid’s feedback as input for your normal code review process. Sigrid’s feedback is related to the quality objectives you defined earlier. This keeps your work aligned with the bigger picture at higher levels of the organization.

## Managing code quality over time 

As a developer, you know that there's no such thing as perfect code. Code quality exists in a context, both social and technical, in which the technologies you choose and the teams you work with can change during the lifetime of a project. That's why, as a developer, actively working on a given codebase and within a rapidly changing team, it's fundamental to have tools that give you insights into how code is evolving over time.
It's okay to accept that the code is not in the state where you want it to be _today_. But, when you see the needle moving in the right direction over time, be it a sprint or a quarter, then you know you are moving in the right direction.
Sigrid offers you timelines on your code quality, allowing you to look at newly added and/or modified code over a certain period of time, so you and your team are in complete control over the quality of your code.
