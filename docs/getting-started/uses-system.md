# Uses: where can Sigrid help me in my role? - System level
This section describes typical uses and analysis questions on system level, looking at details and root causes of system quality findings. 

For system-level details, see [uses-system](../getting-started/uses-system.md).

## System development progress/planning views
To gauge development progress and expected remaining work to be done, you are interested in indications of how predictable code development is. For viewing progress and predicting planning, example analysis questions are:

* For a particular system, where are technical debt and code quality moving towards? Is that what we are expecting?
* If we extrapolate progress, does it seem likely that we can meet planning objectives? How much (unforeseen) technical renovations will we need to take into account?

## System detailed views
Moving deeper into code details, to know what to focus development efforts on, example analysis questions are:

* Does the code show our craftsmanship? Can we explain why code changes are hard when the business asks us for faster delivery?
* In terms of technical debt, are we reaching quality goals? What should be prioritized on the backlog?
* How well are we generally doing securing our systems? Where is this concerning? Are we actually exposed? Are there accepted risks that we accept as a business or false positive findings that we may ignore?
