# Where could Sigrid help me in my role?

Sigrid is aimed at organizational roles that deal with concerns around system health, code quality and their business consequences. Depending on your role you can answer different types of questions. The different roles we distinguish are described here. Specific uses are described in [the portfolio-level overview page](../capabilities/portfolio-overview.md) and [the system-level overview page](../capabilities/system-overview.md).

## Role: Executive/portfolio manager for portfolio/trend views: 
High-level overviews of the software landscape’s composition and quality help you take inventory of your landscape’s *health*, or *risk profile*. This gives direction to future plans. 

Getting started with Sigrid, you may want to start with exploring the dashboard of the [portfolio overview](../capabilities/portfolio-overview.md). From here, [the maintainability details on portfolio level](../capabilities/portfolio-maintainability.md) will take you through system maintainability on landscape level.

## Role: Enterprise Architect for both portfolio views and deep dives
Similarly to manager roles, as an EA you are aided in Sigrid with an overview of the current and desired state of the landscape. From experience we also know that EAs tend to go into technical deep dives, to look for (historical) explanations. So next to the  portfolio-level pages mentioned [above](#role-executiveportfolio-manager-for-portfoliotrend-views).

Note that metrics can be compared to [objectives](../capabilities/objectives.md). By translating business goals to system metric objectives, you have objective metrics to measure against. To start analysis of system-level metrics, start at [the system-level overview](../capabilities/system-overview.md).

## Role: Product Owner for system development progress and planning
To gauge development progress and expected remaining demands, you are interested in indications of how predictable code development is. When progress and trend lines are your main interest, go to [the maintainability detail page](../capabilities/system-maintainability.md) and code evolution [known as "delta quality"](../capabilities/system-delta-quality.md).

To look into the workflows that Sigrid offers you as a PO, you can read the dedicated [workflows section](../workflows/product-owner.md).


## Role: Developer for direct feedback on how to improve your code
In places where Sigrid highlights code quality hotspots, you are interested in going into their details. To understand where and why issues occur. The typical scenario is focusing on code that scores low on maintainability. Typically that code is recognized by developers as tough to modify. The detailed metrics can show what kinds of complexity lies beneath.

The metric details of interest mostly follow from the [system maintainability page](../capabilities/system-maintainability.md), notably [architecture/component dependencies](../capabilities/system-maintainability.md#component-dependencies), [prioritized list of refactoring candidates](../capabilities/system-maintainability.md#refactoring-candidates) and [a code-tree view in the code explorer](../capabilities/system-code-explorer.md) or [alternatively, the technical monitor](../capabilities/system-maintainability.md#note-on-the-technical-monitor).

To look into the workflows that Sigrid offers you as a developer, you can read the dedicated [workflows section](../workflows/developer.md).
