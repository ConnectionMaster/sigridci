# Where could Sigrid help me in my role?

Sigrid is aimed at organizational roles that deal with concerns around system health, code quality and their business consequences. Depending on your role you can answer different types of questions. The different roles we distinguish are described here. Specific uses are described in [uses-portfolio](../getting-started/uses-portfolio.md) and [uses-system](../getting-started/uses-system.md).

## Role: Executive/portfolio manager for portfolio/trend views: 
High-level overviews of the software landscape’s composition and quality help you take inventory of your landscape’s *health*, or *risk profile*. This gives direction to future plans. 

## Role: Enterprise Architect for both portfolio views and deep dives
Similarly to manager roles, as an EA you are aided in Sigrid with an overview of the current and desired state of the landscape. From experience we also know that EAs tend to go into technical deep dives, to look for (historical) explanations. 

## Role: Product Owner for system development progress and planning.
To gauge development progress and expected remaining demands, you are interested in indications of how predictable code development is.

## Role: Software Developer 
Where Sigrid highlights code hotspots, you are interested in going into their details. To understand where and why issues occur. The typical scenario is focusing on code that scores low on maintainability, which are recognized by developers as tough to modify. The detailed metrics can show what kinds of complexity lies beneath.
